<p>There are many dating apps available today, so why make another you might ask?..<br></br><br></br>
  Most dating sites place all users into the same pool, which leads to endlessly trudging through
  people you have nothing in common with. If {"you're"} really into, say, video games, or a particular
  genre of music, and you also find someone into those things, you feel very lucky, after wading
  through potentially hundreds of other profiles of people with nothing in common.<br></br><br></br>
  Patch2 attempts to solve this problem by taking an interest/subculture-based approach first. 
  If you want to meet someone into the same things as you, why should it be so hard? We aim to make it easy.
